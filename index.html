                                    Northern Lights Sled Dog Rescue is a group of committed and experienced rescuers who came together because we wanted to stay true to our shared passion and priorities and keep our rescue about helping dogs. We maintain excellent working relationships with virtually all the leading northern breed rescue groups in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions. We are also proud affiliates of the <a href="http://www.malamuterescue.org/">Alaskan Malamute Assistance League</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501%28c%29_organization">501(c)3</a> non-profit charitable organization recognized by the national breed club, the <a href="http://www.alaskanmalamute.org/">Alaskan Malamute Club of America</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our mission is to advocate for and/or rescue stray, abandoned, displaced or abused dogs; in particular, northern breed dogs facing euthanasia in Midwest/Great Lakes region shelters. Our goal is to place Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and northern breed mixes in loving, experienced, and secure homes with people who understand and celebrate the unique characteristics of their breeds.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Northern Lights is the largest rescuer of Northern Breeds in Indiana.  Since our inception in January, 2004, we have grown in leaps and bounds, having placed over 1200 dogs as of mid-2011.  All of our Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and northern breed mixes are adopted to homes that are thoroughly screened and investigated to ensure the best possible match for each individual dog in terms of the new guardian's experience, lifestyle and home environment.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At Northern Lights, we continually "work smart" to save lives. Our scope and range is not geographic in nature, and is limited only by our own creativity, persistence, commitment, and bonds built within the solid network of knowledgeable and hard-working volunteers and rescue partners we have in surrounding states. The fact is that -- despite the growing rescue movement in the Great Lakes region (Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan) -- the number of abandoned, surrendered and suffering dogs is far too staggering for rescues to handle, particularly if the effort is limited to the confines of individual rescue programs. One of the toughest struggles in rescue is accepting that we can't save them all, but we refuse to quit trying, and we work diligently and creatively toward saving as many as we can by tackling the problem from every angle.  We work in concert with our rescue partners in the Midwest/Great Lakes region every day to ensure the most effective placement of the greatest number of dogs. If a dog is adopted into a great home, we don't care "whose" dog it is -- we're just happy that dog has been saved and that his or her rescue slot can be given to another in need!  If we can assist in ensuring (through posting and screening) the responsible placement of a found or owned dog who will otherwise face the trauma and uncertainty of being dumped in a shelter, we are here to help. This is not a "fee for service" proposition, and we will not solicit a donation for just doing our job. It's about helping dogs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you don't see the dog who might best fit yourself and/or your family on our Pet List, we encourage you to visit other area rescues and shelters on the web or in person.  Why do we refer you elsewhere? Because the bottom line is helping dogs.
                                </p>

                                    We are always in need of cash donations. The homeless and unwanted dogs we pull from shelters almost always require -- at a minimum -- the full spectrum of vaccinations, treatment for parasites, and spay/neuter surgery. In addition, they often come into rescue with kennel cough, respiratory infections, malnutrition or other conditions associated with abuse, neglect, or life as a stray. They seldom have had the benefit of loving care from a caring owner, and thus rarely arrive in perfect health. Most importantly, we have a limited number of foster homes, so sometimes a kennel fee is the only thing that stands between a dog being euthanized in a shelter and our ability to offer emergency placement. Your donation, regardless of size, is always very gratefully accepted. There is no gift too small to make a difference.  Even a little bit goes a long way ... $4.50 will pay for a month of heartworm preventative ... $7 will pay boarding for one pup for one day ...  $10 will pay for standard immunizations, bordatella, or a rabies vaccination.  If you have a bit more to give, $21 will pay for a basic worming ... $25 will pay for a heartworm test ... and $80 will pay for neuter surgery, including antibiotics and pain medication.
                                </p>

                                    Northern Lights' minimal administrative expenses (postage, web hosting, insurance) are easily covered by a small percentage of the income derived from adoption donations.  This means that not one penny of your gift will go to administrative or other frivolous costs, and will be devoted solely to the care of the dogs awaiting their forever homes. If you'd like, you can even specify the dog (or dogs) you'd like to help by noting that dog's name on your check.  We have volunteer legal and other professional services.  Our volunteer base absorbs the costs associated with long distance phone charges, gas for transports, food, toys and treats for the dogs.  This means your donation will go to costs directly associated with "buying time" for a dog who has run out of time at a shelter, or helping sick dogs become healthy, strong, and ready for adoption.

                            What are the most common reasons people surrender dogs to shelters?  Surprisingly, they include easily-resolved issues such as "no time", "doesn't get along with other pets", "can't housebreak", "barks", "allergies", "moving" ... the list goes on and on.  If you are considering giving up your pet for any of these reasons, there's some great practical advice (and even more links) that can help you keep your dog in the loving home he or she already has!
